# Bandhook Kotlin

This project is a small replica of the app I developed some time ago. [Bandhook can still be found on Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.limecreativelabs.bandhook)

At the moment it will only connect to LastFm and retrieve some music bands. It will let navigate to the artist detail. This is what youÂ´ll get:

The purpose of the project is to show a complex (at least in architecture) project entirely written using Kotlin. This example also supports the articles
written in [antonioleiva.com](http://antonioleiva.com) related to Kotlin for Android:

* [Kotlin for Android (I): Introduction](http://antonioleiva.com/kotlin-for-android-introduction/)
* [Kotlin for Android (II): Create a new project](http://antonioleiva.com/kotlin-android-create-project/)
* [Kotlin for Android (III): Extension functions and default values](http://antonioleiva.com/kotlin-android-extension-functions/)
* [Kotlin for Android (IV): Custom Views and Android Extensions](http://antonioleiva.com/kotlin-android-custom-views/)


This sample project is still in development, and could easily break or have some messy code. However, any idea or suggestion to improve it will be welcomed. Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/antoniolg/Bandhook-Kotlin/issues/new) if you think something could be improved.

## How to use this project

You can use Android Studio or Intellij to work with this repository.

First thing you will need to compile this project is to get an [API Key from Last.fm](http://www.lastfm.es/api). It will we used to connect to the service that will provide artists info. Then create a resource file `app/src/main/res/values/api_key.xml` (this path is ignored by git) with the following content:

```xml
<string name="last_fm_api_key">YOUR_KEY</string>
```

The `Kotlin` plugin for Android Studio is also required.

Many ideas on how this project is organized were taken from [Clean Contacts](https://github.com/PaNaVTEC/Clean-Contacts/blob/master/Readme.md) project, by [PaNaVTEC](https://github.com/PaNaVTEC). There are some slight differences, but reading [How to start section](https://github.com/PaNaVTEC/Clean-Contacts/blob/master/Readme.md#how-to-start-with-this-repository) will be helpful.
